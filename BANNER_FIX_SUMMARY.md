# Summary: Banner Persistence & Duplicate Messages Fix

## What Was Wrong

Looking at your logs, I spotted this critical line:
```
LOG  [ConnectionStatus] State transition: true → true
```

The store was **starting as `true` and never changing**, which meant:
- ❌ When WiFi went off: No state transition detected
- ❌ When WiFi came on: No state transition detected  
- ❌ Banner stuck visible (no re-render to hide it)
- ❌ Offline queue never processed (no reconnection detected)
- ❌ Messages duplicated (queued but never cleaned up)

## The Simple Fix

Changed **one line** in `networkStore.ts`:

```typescript
// Before:
isConnected: true, // Assume online initially

// After:
isConnected: false, // Start pessimistic - ConnectionStatus will set correct value on mount
```

This ensures there's always a state transition when the app loads online, establishing a baseline for future transitions.

## Why This Works

| Event | Old Behavior | New Behavior |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| App starts online | `true` → `true` ❌ | `false` → `true` ✅ |
| WiFi goes off | `true` → `true` ❌ | `true` → `false` ✅ |
| WiFi comes on | `true` → `true` ❌ | `false` → `true` ✅ |

With proper state transitions, everything else works:
- ✅ Banner animates correctly
- ✅ Reconnection detected
- ✅ Offline queue processes
- ✅ No duplicate messages

## What You Should See Now

After **restarting the app**:

1. **App starts** → Quick flash as state goes `false` → `true`
2. **Turn WiFi OFF** → Banner appears within 1-5 seconds
3. **Send message** → Shows clock icon (◷)
4. **Turn WiFi ON** → Banner disappears within 1-5 seconds
5. **Wait 3 seconds** → Message syncs (◷ → ✓ → ✓✓)
6. **No duplicates** → Message appears only once

## Files Changed

1. **`src/stores/networkStore.ts`**:
   - Changed initialization: `isConnected: false`
   - Added logging to `setConnected`
   - Removed unused import

2. **`src/components/ConnectionStatus.tsx`** (from earlier):
   - Enhanced logging throughout
   - Always test connectivity when NetInfo says connected
   - Already had all the right detection logic

## Next Steps

**Please restart the app and test!** The fix should be immediate and complete.
