# MUST DO: Fresh Test After Cache Clear

## What I Just Did

1. **Started fresh Expo build** with `--clear` flag to purge all caches
2. **Added debug text to banner** that shows the actual `isConnected` values in real-time

## Critical: You MUST Do This

### Step 1: Wait for Build to Complete
Wait for the terminal showing "Metro waiting on..." or "â€º Press s â”‚ switch to Expo Go"

### Step 2: **Completely Close and Reopen the App**
- In the simulator, press Cmd+Shift+H (home)
- Swipe up and close the app completely  
- Reopen it fresh

### Step 3: Test WiFi Toggle

1. **Start Online** - Verify banner is hidden or says "Connected"
2. **Look at debug text on banner** - Should show `isConnected=true store=true`
3. **Turn WiFi OFF** on Mac
4. **Wait 5 seconds** - Watch the banner
   - Should appear with "No internet connection"
   - Debug text should show `isConnected=false store=false`
5. **Turn WiFi ON** on Mac
6. **Wait 5 seconds** - Watch the banner
   - Should disappear or change to "Connected"
   - Debug text should show `isConnected=true store=true`

## What to Look For in Logs

You MUST see these new logs now:

### On App Start:
```
[NetworkStore] setConnected called: false â†’ true
[ConnectionStatus] ðŸŽ¬ RENDER - isConnected: false store: false
[ConnectionStatus] ðŸŽ¬ RENDER - isConnected: true store: true
```

### When WiFi Goes OFF:
```
[ConnectionStatus] ðŸ“¡ Poll detected state change! true â†’ false
[NetworkStore] setConnected called: true â†’ false
[ConnectionStatus] ðŸ“´ WENT OFFLINE VIA POLLING ðŸ“´
[ConnectionStatus] ðŸŽ¬ RENDER - isConnected: false store: false
```

### When WiFi Comes ON:
```
[ConnectionStatus] ðŸ“¡ Poll detected state change! false â†’ true
[NetworkStore] setConnected called: false â†’ true
[ConnectionStatus] ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ RECONNECTION DETECTED VIA POLLING ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
[ConnectionStatus] ðŸŽ¬ RENDER - isConnected: true store: true
```

## If You STILL Don't See These Logs

Then the code changes aren't being applied. Try:

1. **Kill Metro** (in terminal, press Ctrl+C)
2. **Delete cache manually**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/michaeltornaritis/Desktop/WK2_MessageAI/gauntletai_week2_messageai
   rm -rf node_modules/.cache
   rm -rf .expo
   ```
3. **Restart**:
   ```bash
   npx expo start --clear
   ```
4. **Force reload app**: Press 'r' in the Metro terminal

## What the Debug Banner Will Tell Us

The small text at the bottom of the banner shows:
- **`isConnected`**: What the React component thinks
- **`store`**: What Zustand store actually has

If these don't match â†’ React rendering issue
If both say `true` but banner visible â†’ Animation issue  
If both say `false` but you're online â†’ Detection issue

Please test and share:
1. What the debug text on the banner says
2. The logs from going offlineâ†’online
