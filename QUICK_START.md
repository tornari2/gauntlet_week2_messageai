## 🚀 Get Started in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Firebase Rules (Required)
```bash
cd /Users/michaeltornaritis/Desktop/WK2_MessageAI/gauntletai_week2_messageai
./deploy-database-rules.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
firebase deploy --only database
```

### Step 2: Start the App
```bash
npx expo start
```

### Step 3: Test It Out
1. Open app on two devices
2. Login as different users
3. Send a message from Device A to Device B
4. Watch the notification appear on Device B!

## 📋 What You'll See

### On Device Receiving Message:

**If app is in foreground (not viewing that chat):**
- Beautiful banner slides in from top
- Shows sender name and message
- Auto-dismisses after 4 seconds
- Tap to open chat

**If app is in background:**
- System notification appears
- Tap to open app and chat
- Badge count updates

**If viewing the chat:**
- No notification (it would be annoying!)
- Message appears instantly
- Auto-marked as read

## 🎯 Key Console Logs to Watch

```
🔌 Initializing real-time notifications for user: {userId}
✅ Local notifications registered successfully
```

### When a message is sent:
```
📤 Sent real-time notification to user: {recipientId}
```

### When a notification is received:
```

or
🔔 Showing local notification (app in background)
```

### When viewing a chat:
```
📍 Active chat set to: {chatId}
🔕 Suppressing notification for active chat
```

## 🐛 Quick Troubleshooting

### Notifications not working?
1. ✅ Firebase Realtime Database enabled in Firebase Console?
2. ✅ Database rules deployed (`./deploy-database-rules.sh`)?
3. ✅ Both users logged in?
4. ✅ Internet connection active?
5. ✅ Check console for errors?

### How to verify it's working:
1. Open Firebase Console → Realtime Database
2. Watch `/notifications/{userId}` node
3. Send a message
4. You should see notification appear then disappear

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Test on real devices** for the full experience (simulators work but limited)
2. **Check notification permissions** in device settings if local notifications don't work
3. **Use two different test accounts** for best testing experience
4. **Watch the console logs** - they tell you exactly what's happening
