## 🐛 Part 6: Error Handling

### Firebase Connection Issues
- [ ] **Test 6.1**: RTDB temporarily down
  - Simulate by denying RTDB rules temporarily
  - ✅ Expected: App continues working, typing just doesn't show (graceful degradation)

### Data Corruption
- [ ] **Test 6.2**: Invalid typing data
  - Manually add invalid data to `/typing/{chatId}` in Firebase Console
  - ✅ Expected: App doesn't crash, ignores invalid data

- [ ] **Test 6.3**: Missing user names
  - Delete a user from Firestore
  - Check read receipt modal
  - ✅ Expected: Shows "Unknown User" instead of crashing

---

## ✅ Final Checks

### Code Quality
- [ ] No console errors related to typing or read receipts
- [ ] No memory leaks (check with React DevTools)
- [ ] All TypeScript types correct (no `any` overuse)
- [ ] Proper cleanup in useEffect hooks

### User Experience
- [ ] Animations smooth on both iOS and Android
- [ ] Colors match app theme
- [ ] Text properly formatted and readable
- [ ] No UI jank or flickering

### Firebase Console Verification
- [ ] Check `/typing/{chatId}` path in RTDB
  - Should show data when typing
  - Should auto-clear after ~3 seconds
- [ ] Check `/status/{uid}` still works
- [ ] Check `/notifications/{uid}` still works

## 🔧 Quick Debug Commands

### Check Firebase RTDB in real-time
```javascript
// In browser console (Firebase Console > Realtime Database)
// Watch typing path
firebase.database().ref('typing').on('value', (snap) => {
  console.log('Typing data:', snap.val());
});
```

### Check component state
```javascript
// In ChatScreen.tsx, add temporary logging
console.log('Typing users:', { typingUserIds, typingUserNames });
console.log('Modal state:', { showReadReceiptModal, selectedMessage });
```

### Force cleanup
```javascript
// Clear all typing indicators manually
firebase.database().ref('typing').remove();
```
