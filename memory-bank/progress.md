## Blockers & Risks

### Current Blockers
- None (planning complete, ready to start development)

### Identified Risks
1. **Firebase Free Tier Limits** - May hit limits during heavy testing
   - Mitigation: Monitor usage, use emulator if needed
   
2. **Push Notifications in Expo Go** - Don't work without dev build
   - Mitigation: Test locally, document limitation, create dev build if needed
   
3. **Offline Sync Complexity** - May be harder than estimated
   - Mitigation: Start simple, iterate, well-documented patterns
   
4. **Time Estimate Accuracy** - First time building this type of app
   - Mitigation: Track actual time, adjust estimates, buffer in timeline

- None yet (development not started)

### Future Refactoring
- TBD as we build

### Documentation Gaps
- None (comprehensive documentation complete)

---

## Lessons Learned

### From Planning Phase
1. **Start with architecture** - Having clear architecture documents before coding saves time
2. **Break down into PRs** - Smaller, sequential PRs are easier to manage
3. **Document patterns early** - systemPatterns.md will save time during implementation
4. **Use memory-bank** - Structured context files help with agent collaboration

### To Track During Development
- Will add learnings as we build
- Focus on what works/doesn't with Zustand
- Firebase real-time patterns that work well
- Optimistic UI gotchas
- Testing strategies that work
