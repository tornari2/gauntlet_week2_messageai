// Process after 300ms debounce
setTimeout(() => {
  notificationBuffer.forEach((notifications) => {
    const lastNotification = notifications[notifications.length - 1];
    const count = notifications.length;
    const messageText = count > 1 
      ? `(${count} new messages) ${lastNotification.messageText}` 
      : lastNotification.messageText;
    triggerMessageNotification(...);
  });
}, 300);
```

#### Group Chat Participant Loading
```typescript
// Before: Excluded current user
const otherParticipants = chatData.participants.filter(id => id !== userId);

// After: Include all participants
const allParticipants = chatData.participants;
const participantDetails = await Promise.all(
  allParticipants.slice(0, 6).map(async (participantId) => {
    // Fetch user details including avatarColor
  })
);
```

## Previous Completion: CRITICAL - Presence System Fixed! ✅
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Date:** October 22, 2025
**Commit:** 76bd4f4
**Severity:** Critical bug fix

### The Problem
Users never appeared offline when they closed the app or logged out. This completely broke the presence system - users would appear online indefinitely.

### Root Cause - Architectural Flaw
The mirroring approach didn't work:
- `onDisconnect()` updated Realtime Database when app closed
- A listener was supposed to mirror RTDB → Firestore
- **But** that listener closed with the app!
- Firestore never got updated
- Other users watching Firestore never saw offline status

### The Fix
Changed to watch Realtime Database directly for presence:
- All clients now subscribe to RTDB `/status/{userId}` path
- RTDB's `onDisconnect()` is server-side, works when app closes
- Status updates propagate immediately to all connected clients
- No mirroring needed

### Result
- ✅ User offline after 30-60 seconds when app closes
- ✅ Immediate offline on network disconnect
- ✅ Immediate offline on logout
- ✅ Real-time status updates for all users
- ✅ Presence system fully functional

### Technical Change
```typescript
// Before: Firestore (broken)
onSnapshot(doc(firestore, 'users', userId), ...)

// After: Realtime Database (works!)
onValue(ref(database, `/status/${userId}`), ...)
```

## Previous Completion: Chat List Flicker on Foreground Fixed ✅
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Date:** October 22, 2025
**Commit:** 970f0b2

### The Issue
Brief visual flicker of last messages on chat list when backgrounding and foregrounding the app.

### Root Cause
FlatList was recalculating item layouts on re-render when presence updates came through after foregrounding.

### The Fix
Added FlatList performance optimizations:
- `getItemLayout` - Fixed item dimensions (88px) to prevent layout recalculations
- `removeClippedSubviews` - Only render visible items
- Render batching optimizations (`maxToRenderPerBatch`, `windowSize`, `initialNumToRender`)

### Result
- ✅ No more flicker on foreground
- ✅ Smoother scrolling
- ✅ Better memory efficiency

---

## Previous Completion: Presence System - Background Behavior Fixed ✅
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Date:** October 22, 2025
**Commit:** 0e24872

### The Issue
Users were being marked offline whenever they backgrounded the app (switching apps, receiving calls, etc.), creating a poor user experience.

### The Fix
Removed the aggressive "set offline on background" behavior from `handleAppStateChange()`. Users now stay online when backgrounded and only go offline when:
- Network connection is lost (Firebase `onDisconnect()` auto-handles)
- App is completely killed/closed (Firebase `onDisconnect()` auto-handles)
- User explicitly logs out (`authService.signOut()` calls `setUserOffline()`)

### Result
- ✅ Better online status accuracy
- ✅ Users stay online while app is backgrounded
- ✅ Firebase Realtime Database handles true disconnects automatically
- ✅ More natural user experience

## Previous Completion: CRITICAL BUG FIX - Error Toast Now Working! 🎉
**Status:** COMPLETE ✅
**Date:** October 22, 2025
**Commit:** d83ba78
**Severity:** Critical issue resolved

### The Bug Hunt Journey
After multiple attempts using different state management approaches (useState, useReducer, refs, timing strategies), discovered the root cause through systematic logging:

**The Problem:**
- Error toast notifications were completely broken
- LoginScreen was **unmounting and remounting** during every login attempt
- All state/refs were being destroyed and recreated
- This explained why NO state management approach worked

**Root Cause:**
```
User clicks Login 
→ authStore.login() sets loading: true
→ AppNavigator sees loading=true, shows LoadingScreen
→ AuthStack UNMOUNTS (LoginScreen destroyed)
→ Login fails, loading: false
→ AuthStack REMOUNTS (Fresh LoginScreen, empty state)
→ Error set in new component instance (old refs/state gone)
```

**The Fix:**
1. **Removed Global Loading State**
   - Removed `loading: true/false` from authStore.login() and signup()
   - Each screen uses only its own localLoading state
   - AppNavigator no longer unmounts screens during auth
   - Component stays mounted, error state persists

2. **Disabled Password Autofill**
   - Added `autoComplete="off"` and `textContentType="none"` to TextInputs
   - Eliminates "Save Password" popup on failed logins

### Result
- ✅ Error toast **finally works!** Slides up from bottom with animation
- ✅ Component lifecycle stable during authentication
- ✅ No more password save prompts
- ✅ Smooth UX for error display

### Next Steps
- Clean up extensive debug logging from troubleshooting
- Apply autofill prevention to SignupScreen
- Continue UI polish tasks

### Key Lesson
Component lifecycle issues can make state management appear broken. Always check mount/unmount behavior before trying multiple state approaches.

## Recent Decisions

### Implementation Decisions (Oct 20-21, 2025)
- ✅ **Frontend:** React Native with Expo (managed workflow)
- ✅ **State:** Zustand (over Redux Toolkit and Context API)
- ✅ **Navigation:** React Navigation (over Expo Router)
- ✅ **Backend:** Firebase (Auth, Firestore, FCM)
- ✅ **Deployment:** Expo Go for MVP, EAS Build for production

### Bug Fixes & Learnings (Oct 21, 2025)
- ✅ **Firestore null vs undefined:** Changed all `|| undefined` to `|| null` (6 locations in authService.ts)
- ✅ **Display names bug:** Fixed `participantName` → `otherUserName` in chatService.ts

  - Firestore listener provides authoritative message version
  - Applied to sendMessageOptimistic, retryMessage, and processOfflineQueue
- ✅ **Network status flicker (NEW):** Fixed UI flicker when going offline/online
  - Removed unused dependencies from ConnectionStatus component
  - Used refs to store callbacks and prevent re-renders
  - NetInfo listener now only sets up once on mount

## Active Constraints

### Time Constraints
- Target: 6-8 days at 8 hours/day
- MVP must be complete before AI integration phase

### Technical Constraints
- Must work on Expo Go (for easy testing)
- Must work offline (queue messages)
- Must support iOS and Android
- Firebase free tier limits (50K reads/day)

### Scope Constraints
- **In Scope:** Core messaging, groups, status, receipts, notifications
- **Out of Scope:** Media sharing, voice/video calls, E2EE, message editing, typing indicators

## Blockers & Dependencies

### Current Blockers
- **None** - All critical bugs fixed, system is stable and performant
  - ✅ Offline message status working correctly
  - ✅ Presence system reliable (survives force-close)
  - ✅ Chat list performance optimized (no flicker)
  - ✅ Duplicate key warnings eliminated
  - ✅ Network status transitions smooth (no flicker)
  - Ready for push notification testing on physical device

### Items Needing Cleanup
- Duplicate files in repo (`MessageBubble 2.tsx`, `MessageInput 2.tsx`, `messageStore 2.ts`, `dateHelpers 2.ts`, `firestore 2.rules`)
- Should remove these duplicate files

### Upcoming Dependencies
- **PR #10 (Push Notifications)** - Depends on PR #4 ✅ (complete)
- **PR #11 (User Profile)** - Depends on PR #2 ✅ (complete)
- **PR #12 (UI Polish)** - Depends on all previous PRs

## Questions to Resolve

### Current Questions
- [ ] Should we add automated tests for message persistence?
- [ ] Any bugs discovered during PR #8 testing?
- [ ] Should we implement group chat or push notifications next?

### Resolved Questions
- [x] Firebase project name? → Used Firebase Console defaults
- [x] Bundle identifier? → `com.anonymous.gauntletaiweek2messageai`
- [x] Use Firebase Emulator? → No, using live Firebase
- [x] Why "Unknown User"? → Fixed: used wrong property name
- [x] Why Firestore errors? → Fixed: undefined vs null issue
- [x] How to track presence? → AppState listener with Firestore updates
- [x] Last seen format? → "Active X ago" using formatLastSeen helper
- [x] Read receipt colors? → White for delivered, blue for read
- [x] Auto-read approach? → useFocusEffect when screen focused
- [x] Firestore persistence in RN? → Automatic, no web APIs needed
- [x] How to cache messages? → AsyncStorage with 100 message limit
- [x] Offline queue approach? → Store in AsyncStorage, retry on reconnection

## Context for AI Agents

### When Starting New Work Session
**Quick Context:**
- Project: WhatsApp clone MVP with React Native + Expo + Firebase
- Current Status: **PRs #1-9 complete** ✅
- Core messaging with optimistic updates, presence, read receipts, persistence, and groups working
- Ready for: Push Notifications (PR #10)
- Reference: `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for detailed tasks
- Reference: `ARCHITECTURE.md` for system design

**Files to Review:**
- `memory-bank/progress.md` - See what's been completed (75% done)
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - PR #10 tasks (next)
- PR summaries: `PR4_SUMMARY.md`, `PR5_SUMMARY.md`, `PR6_SUMMARY.md`, `PR7_SUMMARY.md`, `PR8_SUMMARY.md`, `PR9_SUMMARY.md`
- Bug fix docs: `BUG_FIXES.md`, `FIX_UNKNOWN_USER.md`, `UI_CHANGES.md`

### When Implementing Features
**Key Patterns Learned:**
- Always use `null` instead of `undefined` for Firestore
- Use `ChatWithDetails` type instead of `Chat` for proper display names
- Firebase persistence warnings on React Native are normal
- Real-time listeners pattern: Zustand store → subscribe in useEffect → cleanup on unmount
- Type safety prevents bugs (learned from `otherUserName` vs `participantName` issue)
- AppState API for presence tracking is reliable and efficient
- Allow `Timestamp | Date` unions for Firebase/app data flexibility
- OnlineIndicator component pattern: dot + optional text, multiple sizes
- useFocusEffect perfect for screen-focused actions (like marking messages read)
- Read receipt logic: compare readBy array with participants array
- Unread count: calculate in subscribeToUserChats for real-time updates
- Firestore persistence: automatic in RN, no web APIs needed
- AsyncStorage strategy: cache last 100 messages, serialize timestamps
- Offline queue: store failures, retry on reconnection
- Cache error handling: failures shouldn't crash app

**Reference Files:**
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Data flow diagrams
- `systemPatterns.md` - Implementation patterns
- `techContext.md` - TypeScript types and structure

### When Writing Tests
**Testing Standards:**
- Target: >80% code coverage
- Unit tests for all services and stores
- Component tests for all UI components
- Integration tests for critical flows
- Reference: `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for test examples per PR

## Development Environment

### Current Setup Status
- [x] Expo CLI installed
- [x] Node.js version verified (18+)
- [x] VS Code / Cursor with extensions
- [x] Git configured
- [x] Firebase account created
- [x] Firebase project set up
- [x] iOS Simulator ready
- [x] Testing on physical devices
- [x] App running successfully

### Required Before Starting
1. Install Expo CLI: `npm install -g expo-cli`
2. Verify Node version: `node --version` (should be 18+)
3. Create Firebase account
4. Set up iOS Simulator or Android Emulator
5. Have physical device for testing (optional but recommended)

## Communication Patterns

### For This Project
When asking AI for help, mention:
- Current PR number (e.g., "Working on PR #4")
- What you're implementing (e.g., "Implementing message store")
- Reference documentation (e.g., "@ARCHITECTURE.md show message flow")

### Efficient Prompts
```
Good: "Following PR #2 in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, implement the auth store"
Good: "@ARCHITECTURE.md show auth flow, then implement authService.ts"
Good: "Generate tests for messageStore per PR #4 specifications"

Less effective: "Create an auth system"
Less effective: "Make the messaging work"
```

- **Include JSDoc comments for all functions**
- **Use TypeScript strict mode** (no `any` types)
- **Clean up listeners on unmount**

### Common Commands
```bash
# Start dev server
npx expo start

# Clear cache
npx expo start --clear

# Run tests
npm test

# Type checking
