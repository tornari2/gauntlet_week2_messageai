✅ **Completed:**
1. Installed notification dependencies (expo-notifications, expo-device)
2. Created notificationService.ts with token registration
3. Added push token storage in Firestore
4. Implemented notification handlers (foreground/background)
5. Set up deep linking to chats
6. Configured Android notification channels
7. Fixed projectId error in app.json

🔄 **Remaining:**
1. Test push notifications on physical device
2. Send test notifications using Expo Push Tool
3. Verify deep linking works from notification taps
4. Test all states (foreground/background/quit)
5. Document notification setup and testing

📝 **Note:** Push notifications require physical device or development build (not fully testable in Expo Go for production)

## Recent Decisions

### Implementation Decisions (Oct 20-21, 2025)
- ✅ **Frontend:** React Native with Expo (managed workflow)
- ✅ **State:** Zustand (over Redux Toolkit and Context API)
- ✅ **Navigation:** React Navigation (over Expo Router)
- ✅ **Backend:** Firebase (Auth, Firestore, FCM)
- ✅ **Deployment:** Expo Go for MVP, EAS Build for production

### Bug Fixes & Learnings (Oct 21, 2025)
- ✅ **Firestore null vs undefined:** Changed all `|| undefined` to `|| null` (6 locations in authService.ts)
- ✅ **Display names bug:** Fixed `participantName` → `otherUserName` in chatService.ts
- ✅ **Type consistency:** Changed chatStore to use `ChatWithDetails` instead of `Chat`
- ✅ **Firebase persistence:** Clarified React Native uses memory cache (expected behavior)
- ✅ **Firestore orderBy:** Removed to avoid index requirements in early development
- ✅ **NewChatScreen:** Added floating action button and user selection screen
- ✅ **Nullable types:** Updated User type to allow `null` for `photoURL` and `pushToken`
- ✅ **Timestamp handling:** OnlineIndicator accepts `Timestamp | Date` for flexibility
- ✅ **AppState tracking:** Reliable presence tracking via React Native AppState API
- ✅ **Real-time presence:** Efficient Firestore listeners for online status updates
- ✅ **Read receipt logic:** getReadReceiptIcon() checks readBy array against participants
- ✅ **useFocusEffect:** Perfect for auto-reading messages when chat screen focused
- ✅ **Unread counting:** Calculate in subscribeToUserChats for real-time badge updates
- ✅ **Blue checks:** Color changes from white to blue when all participants read
- ✅ **Firestore persistence APIs:** Web-only APIs don't exist in React Native (persistentLocalCache, persistentMultipleTabManager)
- ✅ **AsyncStorage for instant display:** Complements Firestore's automatic persistence
- ✅ **Cache error handling:** Cache failures should never crash app, just log and continue
- ✅ **NetInfo reliability:** Perfect for connection state monitoring and offline queue processing
- ✅ **Offline queue pattern:** Store failed messages, retry on reconnection automatically
- ✅ **Offline message status (NEW):** Fixed messages showing checkmark instead of clock when offline
  - Created networkStore to track connection state globally
  - Messages now show pending (clock) state when offline
  - Queue persists indefinitely in AsyncStorage until sent
- ✅ **Presence system reliability (NEW):** Fixed status not updating when app force-closed
  - Integrated Firebase Realtime Database with onDisconnect() handlers
  - Status automatically updates even when app crashes or network drops
  - Mirrored presence data between RTDB and Firestore
- ✅ **Chat list flickering (NEW):** Fixed entire chat item flickering when status changed
  - Memoized ChatListItem with custom comparison function
  - Memoized OnlineIndicator to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - Only the dot updates now, no full component re-render
- ✅ **NetInfo listener issues (NEW):** Fixed connection status banner persisting after reconnect
  - Removed isConnected from useEffect dependencies
  - Used functional setState to avoid stale state issues
- ✅ **AppState change detection (NEW):** Fixed AppState listener not triggering
  - Wrapped handler in useCallback for proper memoization
  - Reordered code to define function before useEffect

## Active Constraints

## Context for AI Agents

### When Starting New Work Session
**Quick Context:**
- Project: WhatsApp clone MVP with React Native + Expo + Firebase
- Current Status: **PRs #1-9 complete** ✅
- Core messaging with optimistic updates, presence, read receipts, persistence, and groups working
- Ready for: Push Notifications (PR #10)
- Reference: `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for detailed tasks
- Reference: `ARCHITECTURE.md` for system design

**Files to Review:**
- `memory-bank/progress.md` - See what's been completed (75% done)
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - PR #10 tasks (next)

- Bug fix docs: `BUG_FIXES.md`, `FIX_UNKNOWN_USER.md`, `UI_CHANGES.md`

### When Implementing Features
**Key Patterns Learned:**
- Always use `null` instead of `undefined` for Firestore
- Use `ChatWithDetails` type instead of `Chat` for proper display names
- Firebase persistence warnings on React Native are normal
- Real-time listeners pattern: Zustand store → subscribe in useEffect → cleanup on unmount
- Type safety prevents bugs (learned from `otherUserName` vs `participantName` issue)
- AppState API for presence tracking is reliable and efficient
- Allow `Timestamp | Date` unions for Firebase/app data flexibility
- OnlineIndicator component pattern: dot + optional text, multiple sizes
- useFocusEffect perfect for screen-focused actions (like marking messages read)
- Read receipt logic: compare readBy array with participants array
- Unread count: calculate in subscribeToUserChats for real-time updates
- Firestore persistence: automatic in RN, no web APIs needed
- AsyncStorage strategy: cache last 100 messages, serialize timestamps
- Offline queue: store failures, retry on reconnection
- Cache error handling: failures shouldn't crash app

## Communication Patterns

### For This Project
When asking AI for help, mention:
- Current PR number (e.g., "Working on PR #4")
- What you're implementing (e.g., "Implementing message store")
- Reference documentation (e.g., "@ARCHITECTURE.md show message flow")

### Efficient Prompts
```
Good: "Following PR #2 in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, implement the auth store"
Good: "@ARCHITECTURE.md show auth flow, then implement authService.ts"
Good: "Generate tests for messageStore per PR #4 specifications"

Less effective: "Create an auth system"
Less effective: "Make the messaging work"
```
