# Product Context: WhatsApp Clone MVP

## Product Vision
Create a familiar, reliable messaging experience that serves as a foundation for future AI-powered communication features.

## User Needs & Use Cases

### Primary Use Cases

   - Group messages must reach all participants
   - Read status should show who has seen messages

3. **Availability Awareness**
   - Users want to know if contacts are online
   - Last seen timestamps for offline users
   - Immediate status updates

4. **Message Confirmation**
   - Users need to know messages were delivered
   - Users want to know when messages are read
   - Visual feedback (checkmarks) for status

- App launch time: < 3 seconds
- Smooth scrolling: 60 fps with 1000+ messages

### Reliability Targets
- 99.9% message delivery success rate
- Zero message loss
- Graceful offline/online transitions

### Scalability Targets (MVP)
- Support 10,000 concurrent users
- Groups up to 50 participants
- 50,000 messages per chat history

### Security

## Metrics to Track

### Technical Metrics
- Message delivery rate
- Average latency
- App crash rate
- Optimistic UI success rate

### User Metrics
- Messages per session
- Session length
- Notification open rate
- Group creation rate

## Known Limitations (MVP)

1. **No media sharing** - Text only
2. **No message editing** - Send only
3. **No typing indicators** - Focus on core messaging first
4. **Push notifications require dev build** - Won't work in Expo Go
5. **No end-to-end encryption** - Standard Firebase security
6. **Limited offline support** - Queue only, no full offline mode
7. **No message search** - Browse history only
8. **Basic group features** - No admin controls, kick/mute, etc.

## Design Philosophy

### Mobile-First

### Offline-First
- Cache-then-network pattern
- Queue operations when offline
- Sync when connection restored

### Real-Time First
- WebSocket-based updates (Firestore)
- No polling
- Instant synchronization

### User-Centric
- Clear feedback
- Forgiving errors
- Easy recovery from failures
