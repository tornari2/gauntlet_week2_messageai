# Fix: Android Back Button Not Clickable

## Problem

The back button in the ChatScreen header was not clickable on Android devices. Touches on the back button were being blocked by absolutely positioned overlay components.

## Root Cause

Two components were positioned absolutely at the top of the screen with high z-index values, blocking touch events:

1. **NotificationBanner** - `zIndex: 9999`, position: absolute
2. **ConnectionStatus** - `zIndex: 1000`, position: absolute

Even when these components were hidden (slid off-screen or not displaying content), they were still capturing touch events and preventing touches from reaching the ChatScreen header underneath.

## Solution

Added `pointerEvents` prop to both components to allow touches to pass through when the overlays shouldn't block interaction:

### 1. NotificationBanner Fix
```typescript
<Animated.View
  style={[styles.container, { transform: [{ translateY: slideAnim }] }]}
  pointerEvents="box-none"  // ✅ Allow touches to pass through
>
```

**Behavior:**
- The container doesn't capture touch events
- Child components (banner content) can still be tapped
- Touches pass through to components underneath when not hitting the banner

### 2. ConnectionStatus Fix
```typescript
<Animated.View
  style={[styles.container, { transform: [{ translateY: slideAnim }] }]}
  pointerEvents={isConnected ? 'none' : 'box-none'}  // ✅ Don't block when hidden
>
```

**Behavior:**
- When connected (banner hidden): `pointerEvents="none"` - all touches pass through
- When offline (banner showing): `pointerEvents="box-none"` - banner is tappable but doesn't block other touches

## Understanding pointerEvents

React Native's `pointerEvents` prop controls how views respond to touch events:

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `auto` | Default - view can be the target of touch events |
| `none` | View is never the target of touch events (all touches pass through) |
| `box-none` | View is NOT a target, but its children CAN be targets |
| `box-only` | View CAN be a target, but its children CANNOT be |

## Why This Works

### Before Fix
```
Touch on back button
  ↓
Hits NotificationBanner (position: absolute, zIndex: 9999)
  ↓
Event captured by banner container
  ↓
❌ Back button never receives the touch
```

### After Fix
```
Touch on back button
  ↓
Hits NotificationBanner (pointerEvents="box-none")
  ↓
Banner container ignores touch
  ↓
Touch passes through to ChatScreen header
  ↓
✅ Back button receives the touch and works!
```

## Files Modified

1. **src/components/NotificationBanner.tsx**
   - Added `pointerEvents="box-none"` to container

2. **src/components/ConnectionStatus.tsx**
   - Added dynamic `pointerEvents={isConnected ? 'none' : 'box-none'}` to container

## Testing

After this fix, verify:
- ✅ Back button is clickable on Android
- ✅ Back button is clickable on iOS
- ✅ Notification banner is still tappable when visible
- ✅ Notification banner dismiss button still works
- ✅ Connection status banner doesn't block touches

## Why This Issue Was More Noticeable on Android

Android's touch target areas and hit testing might be slightly different from iOS, making this blocking issue more apparent on Android devices. The fix works universally for both platforms.

## Prevention

When using absolutely positioned overlays with high z-index:
- Always consider `pointerEvents` to prevent blocking unintended touches
- Use `pointerEvents="box-none"` for containers that should allow pass-through
- Test on both iOS and Android as touch behavior can vary

## Related Concepts

This fix relates to similar issues with:
- Modal overlays blocking touches
- Drawer navigation blocking underlying content
- Floating action buttons blocking interactive elements
- Notification toasts blocking headers/navigation

The key is to be intentional about which components should capture touches and which should allow pass-through.
